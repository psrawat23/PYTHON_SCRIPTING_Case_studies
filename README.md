# PYTHON_SCRIPTING_Case_studies
This project contain the two case study projects as specified below  Program files are saved as cs1.py and cs2.py and Output result of these programs are uploaded in Master reposetory as Output_cs1 and output_cs2.

  Case study– 1: Filename: cs1.py

Implement a multithreaded solution that takes file name(s) as command-line
